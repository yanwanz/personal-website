I’m interested in understanding how children and adults represent - or learn to represent - complex meanings in their mind. I’m especially interested in abstract logical expressions (broadly defined) and learnability problems. At Brown, I’m advised by Roman Feiman and affiliated with the BLT lab.\nBefore coming to Brown, I was an undergraduate studying Linguistics and Statistical & Data Sciences at Smith College. At Smith, I worked with Jill de Villiers on language acquisition and assessment.\nMy name\nIPA: /\\(jɛnwan \\; ʈʂu\\)/\nAll segments in my first name exist in English\nMy last name is similar to the first syllable of juice ( /\\(ʤuː\\)/).\n\n\n\n\n\n",
