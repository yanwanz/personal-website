I’m interested in understanding how children and adults represent - or learn to represent - complex meanings in their mind. At Brown, I’m advised by Roman Feiman and affiliated with the BLT lab.\nBefore coming to Brown, I was an undergraduate studying Linguistics and Statistical & Data Sciences at Smith College. I mainly worked with Jill de Villiers on language acquisition and assessment.\nAbout my name\nIPA: /\\(jɛnwan \\; ʈʂu\\)/\nAll segments in my first name exist in English and my last name is similar to the first syllable of juice ( /\\(ʤuː\\)/).\n\n\n\n",
