I’m interested in understanding how children and adults represent - or learn to represent - complex meanings in their mind. At Brown, I’m advised by Roman Feiman and affiliated with the BLT lab.\nBefore coming to Brown, I was an undergraduate studying Linguistics and Statistics & Data Sciences at Smith College. I mainly worked with Jill de Villiers on language acquisition and assessment.\nAbout my name\nIPA: /jɛnwan ʈʂu/\nAll segments in my first name exist in English and my last name is similar to the first syllable of juice ( /ʤuː/).\n\n\n\n",
