### About me

Hi! I'm a first year PhD student in the [Department of Cognitive, Linguistic and Psychological Sciences](https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/home) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/). I'm interested in understanding how children and adults represent - or learn to represent - complex meanings in their mind. At Brown, I'm advised by [Roman Feiman](https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/people/faculty/roman-feiman) and affiliated with the [BLT lab](https://sites.brown.edu/bltlab/). 

Before coming to Brown, I was an undergraduate studying Linguistics and [Statistical & Data Sciences](https://twitter.com/smithcollegesds) at [Smith College](https://www.smith.edu/). I mainly worked with [Jill de Villiers](https://www.smith.edu/academics/faculty/jill-de-villiers) on language acquisition and assessment.

### About my name

- [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet): /$jɛnwan \; ʈʂu$/

- All segments in my first name exist in English and my last name is similar to the first syllable of *juice* ( /$ʤuː$/).
