### Ongoing

Currently, I am working on a project exploring young children's production and comprehension of sentences containing "if" and "when" and their concepts of (un)certainty.


### Past projects

Here are some projects I've worked on in the past.

- Perception of Mandarin nasal codas by Shanghainese bilinguals

- Adults' and children's comprehension of Neg-raising (*With Jill de Villiers, Lydia Quevedo, Lily Berlstein, and Iris Zhong*)

- Children's comprehension of factive verbs and wh-questions
